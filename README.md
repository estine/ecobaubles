## Bobbles

- #### Generator-Processors

    - *MurMini* — Flocking Simulation-Driven Granular Synthesizer
    - *AcousTransMini* — Acoustic Niche Hypothesis-Informed Sound Mapper

- #### Effects
    - *LVFX* - Predator-Prey Model (Lotka–Volterra Equations) Effects Rack
    - *EvoMunger* - Evolutionary Algorithm Model Sound Transformer

## Goals / Hopes / Dreams

#### Export Targets
- RNBO exported VSTs without GUI (Max)
- JUCE- or HISE-created VSTs with GUI (C++, Javascript)
- M4L devices for Ableton Live with GUI (Max)

#### Design Principles
- Slick, easy to evaluate and execute GUIs
- Comprehensive but not overwhelming parameter spaces (use multiplexing)
- Lots of audio demos and use within my music
- Async as well as syncing to BPM and beat grid
