Predator-Prey Model (Lotkaâ€“Volterra Equations) LFO Generator

Part of EcoBobbles: ecologically informed VST Plug-ins and M4L Devices for sound creation and manipulation. Extensions of Eli Stine's 2019 dissertation, [*Modeling Natural Systems in Immersive Electroacoustic Music*](http://www.elistine.com/diss).

## Overview

The Lotka-Volterra equations are simple predator-prey models of competition between multiple (usually two) species over time. The result is a complex adaptive system with really interesting behavior. In this plug-in, the size of the populations of the multiple species are used as control rate (LFO) data, to control any audio parameters desired.
