Build it in RNBO
Take MIDI in as an ordered list (from low to high)
Iterate over that list to generate MIDI notes (using makenote) - based on ordering
Speed of iteration is based on rate
Length of note is based on note duration scalars
Velocity, Octave, and Note deviations are based on scalars

Start with just sliders and then go to am actual crystal-themed front-end...

//

Parameter Space:

MIDI in

Arpeggiation Ordering (Up, Down, All Other Permutations) selection
Randomize Order scalar

Rate scalar

Note duration scalar
Note duration as percentage OR as absolute time boolean

Randomize Velocity scalar
Randomize Octave scalar
Randomize Notes scalar

(BONUS: MPE parameters for each note, including aftertouch...)
